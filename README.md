# The Hipster PDA

Analog (or analogue!) tools for getting and staying organized, based largely on David Allen (2001) _Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity_ (Penguin) (hereafter refered to as "GTD").

## Resources: The Hipster PDA

[Introducing the Hipster PDA](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda), Merlin Mann, 2004/09/03 -- the best place to start, explicating on the simplicity of the idea and with a plethora of curated links. Part of [_43 Folders_](http://www.43folders.com/), a site that Mann compiled to "provide a gentle, geek-centric introduction to _Getting Things Done_."

* [D\*I\*Y Planner Hipster PDA Edition](http://www.diyplanner.com/templates/official/hpda) -- downloads of PDF files with templates for index cards following and expanding on the GTD methods. Note that the "1-Up Version" may not unzip with certain software; I've [unzipped and rezipped it here](DiyP3_hipsterPDA_1up_rezip.zip), and made available a [stand-alone of the PDF file of the core templates](diyp3h_core_1up.pdf).

* [The Hipster PDA 2009-2010](http://spencerdub.me/blog/2015/03/hipster-pda/) -- a blog article, recounting the author's adapted implementation of the Hipster PDA

* [Personal Analog Device](http://wiki.c2.com/?PersonalAnalogDevice) -- a source (compiled from usenet?) with ideas about the _why_ of analog solutions
